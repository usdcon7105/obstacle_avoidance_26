     similar to how @calculateDirection works, verticalCorridor segments the screen in 3
     sections of equal size, and uses the object's centerYpercentage to determine its
     position relative to the screen.

        PS: combining these two functions should be enough to acomplish our corridor
     calculation....
     basically we can determine an object's X and Y possition and determine if its on a
     significant treat zone. distance from LiDar will be crutial for this as we don't want
     to compute something as being in the in the upper hald of the screen if the object
     is far away...
